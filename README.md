This is my first game creation using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I made this because the best way to learn coding is to do it. Once I had learnt enough coding fundamentals and concepts, I decided to apply my knowledge in a game, to see if my comprehension of 
programming was good enough to make a functioning game. This is the result of that!
